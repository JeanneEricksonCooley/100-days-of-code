# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I cleaned up my resume site (code and content) built using HTML, CSS, JS, & Bootstrap. I committed the changes to GitHub. I forked the #100DaysOfCode repo.

**Thoughts:** This challenge is going to be very helpful with (1) getting in the habit of coding every day, and (2) getting in the habit of committing to GitHub (something I've not been consistent doing).

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started working on a redesign of my freelancing info site. I worked primarily with the CSS, but started the process of converting this to a one-page site (rather than separate HTML files for each page).

**Thoughts:** I'm shaking off the cobwebs. I haven't consistently coded in a while.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Doghouse Web site. Created a reset/normalize CSS file separate from main CSS file. Cleaning up file structure slightly.

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty amazed at how much I can get done in an hour when it's focused time.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started info site for my son.

**Thoughts:** I played with the thought that I'd build this in WordPress. Ultimately, this will be a fairly simple site that I want to build using some specific tools/languages.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on my son's info site some more. Created repository on GitHub for site.

**Thoughts:** I shocked myself when I remembered how to use the terminal to initialize git in this project file & push to the GitHub repository. This is a very simple site, but it really is going to help me get back to coding.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I'm working on styling for my son's site. I added a w3-sidenav yesterday and am working on styling it.

**Thoughts:** I'm trying to center the text within the nav sections. I'm having trouble getting the text to show up opaque (I have the nav section set up at 0.3 opacity & only want the background transparent, not the text). Goal for tomorrow is to fix these two things, add title/header bar, make navbar responsive, and start adding content to the other three sections.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I updated some of the content and styling on my freelancing site. I made the title section responsive using a media query. I continued to work on my son's site, adding content, styling, and working on responsive layout. I have the mobile nav working, I need to make it a little more user friendly.

**Thoughts:** There are so many little things that I could waste time on and really not get the project done. I'm working on making meaningful forward progress every day and I'll work on polishing up the projects after I get a useable sites up.
