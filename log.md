# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I cleaned up my resume site (code and content) built using HTML, CSS, JS, & Bootstrap. I committed the changes to GitHub. I forked the #100DaysOfCode repo.

**Thoughts:** This challenge is going to be very helpful with (1) getting in the habit of coding every day, and (2) getting in the habit of committing to GitHub (something I've not been consistent doing).

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started working on a redesign of my freelancing info site. I worked primarily with the CSS, but started the process of converting this to a one-page site (rather than separate HTML files for each page).

**Thoughts:** I'm shaking off the cobwebs. I haven't consistently coded in a while.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Doghouse Web site. Created a reset/normalize CSS file separate from main CSS file. Cleaning up file structure slightly.

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty amazed at how much I can get done in an hour when it's focused time.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started info site for my son.

**Thoughts:** I played with the thought that I'd build this in WordPress. Ultimately, this will be a fairly simple site that I want to build using some specific tools/languages.
